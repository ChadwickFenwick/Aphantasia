Scientific & UX Guidelines: "Monocle" Training Efficacy1. The "Optical Priming" ProtocolTo "wake up" the visual cortex, the app should follow a specific sequence in every session.High-Contrast Priming: Start every session with a "Gabor Patch" (fuzzy striped circles). These are scientifically proven to stimulate the primary visual cortex ($V1$).The 10-Second Rule: After displaying a stimulus, there must be a forced 10-second "darkness" period. This is where the actual training happens—forcing the brain to "reconstruct" what it just saw.2. Progressive Complexity (The Ladder)Do not overwhelm an aphantasic user with complex scenes. Follow this data-driven progression:Level 1 (Static): Simple 2D shapes (Square, Circle) in primary colors.Level 2 (Dynamic): Rotating 3D wireframes (using your Three.js setup).Level 3 (Relational): Two shapes of different colors interacting (e.g., a blue cube passing through a red ring).Level 4 (Complex): Real-world objects with texture (e.g., a "fuzzy" tennis ball).3. The "Voice-to-Vision" LoopResearch suggests that language and vision are deeply linked.Guideline: Integrate a "Describe Mode."Feature: While the user is in the "darkness" phase, provide a button to record their voice. Use an AI transcription tool (like Whisper API) to log their descriptions.The Hack: Describing the details of an image (e.g., "The left edge is slightly brighter") forces the brain to scan a mental map, even if the user "sees" nothing.4. Biofeedback & Gamma WavesVisualization is often associated with specific brain states.Guideline: Use Binaural Beats.Implementation: Offer an optional audio toggle that plays subtle 10Hz (Alpha) or 40Hz (Gamma) frequencies. Alpha helps with relaxation/internal focus, while Gamma is linked to high-level information processing and "binding" visual features.5. Habituation Prevention (The "Surprise" Factor)The brain ignores what is predictable.Guideline: Randomized Stimuli.Implementation: Never show the same shape in the same color twice in a row. Use a randomizer for the Three.js geometry to keep the visual cortex "surprised" and engaged.6. Ethical Scaling & Expectation ManagementThe "Frustration" Barrier: Aphantasics often feel frustrated when they see "nothing."UX Solution: Include a "Progressive Wins" system. Even if they don't see an image, reward them for "Spatial Awareness" (e.g., "You correctly identified where the square was located in the dark!"). This validates their effort and prevents burnout.
