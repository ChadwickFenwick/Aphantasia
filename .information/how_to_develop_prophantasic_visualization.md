Prerequisites
If you do not know what prophantasia is, please read this post first.

Sight occurs in the brain when signals from the optic nerves go to the brain, and eventually end up in the visual cortex, where all one sees (real sight as well as visualization) are processed.

When one visualizes with traditional phantasia, they are providing additional signals to the visual cortex, not originating from the optic nerves, and the mind generates visuals but separates them from the visual “screen” that the eyes’ visuals occupy.

When one visualizes with prophantasia, from what I’ve gathered from both anecdotal experience and preliminary research, they seem to override the signal at an earlier point in the visual process, before the signals are formatted in the visual cortex, causing the visualization to not get separated from the eyes’ “screen”, as the cortex doesn’t know the difference in the origin of the signal. These visualizations merge into the visual “screen” that the eyes’ visuals occupy, thus you actually truly see your visualizations with your eyes.



Accessing the Screen
To begin developing prophantasic visualization, you must first learn to “access the screen”. Put simply, this is learning how to override the visual signals coming from one’s optic nerves to one’s visual cortex. This is the first and most important stage of learning prophantasic visualization.

I have created a simple exercise which can teach your brain how to begin to override these signals, thus “access the screen”.

Please save this image I have made to your phone.

Now, look at the first shape for less than 1/4 of a second, it is very important that you never look at this image for more than a mere glance. Once the 1/4 second has passed, sharply look away at a nearby wall. While looking away, attempt to keep your eyes’ focal settings as they just were when you were looking at the image, do not attempt to allow your eyes to adjust to the wall you are now looking towards. Try to continue seeing the shape that you were just looking at on your phone’s screen, as if you were dragging it along in your eyesight as you looked away from the screen and towards the wall. At first you will likely not succeed with this, but keep trying.

Go to the next shape and try again. Attempt each shape only once before proceeding to the next shape. Re-start after all 6 shapes have been attempted.

Stay very relaxed, you do need to keep your focus but you shouldn't be straining. The more relaxed you are, the easier this process can be.

Pay very close attention as you look away, and try to detect even the smallest difference in your eye-sight that may seem like it’s related to the shape/color you were just looking at, give that all of your focus and try to focus more on it each time you do this.

When you succeed in “accessing the screen”, you will look away from the shape, towards a wall, and you will feel a change in your mental focus, this feeling will feel similar to “zoning out”, you will (very vaguely) still be seeing the shape in its original form and true colors, in your eye-sight (again, this will be very vague and non-vivid at first, that’s okay).

Consider you were looking at the shape that is the magenta circle with the cyan background: a beginner level success-case may look like this (look closely, it's easy to miss), while a slightly more developed success-case may look like this.

This is not an artifact of the eyes, this is the beginnings of prophantasic visualization. Your brain is overriding the signals going from your optic nerves to your visual cortex with data from your short-term memory. Eventually, as this all develops, you will be able to control this image you retain in your eyesight, because, again, it’s not an artifact of the eyes, it is visualization of the mind—but, I will discuss more on that in the next post of this series, for now just practice “accessing the screen” until you can consistently do it every time.

Important: If you are seeing the shape in its true colors as you look away, and it still looks as you were just seeing it, then you have succeeded in “accessing the screen”. If you are seeing some sort of inverse-color effect, then you are seeing an artifact of the eyes and not prophantasic visuals, this is occurring because you looked at the image too long (or too many times in a row) and your eyes cones/rods got fatigue which is causing an inverse ghost image to be in your eye sight due to weaker/fatigued optic signals in those regions—for this reason, only ever look at the image for less than 1/4 of a second, and only look at each shape once before moving on to the next shape.

Before beginning with part two, you must be at the point where you can see the shapes from the first post nearly as brightly and clearly as you were originally looking at them, for at least the first half-second after looking away. It should look something like this. If you aren’t there yet, please continue training with the first post until you reach that point.


Brightness and Persistence Training
I have developed a technique called “image chaining” which teaches you to keep your visuals in your prophantasic field-of-view for increasing durations.

For this exercise, you will need to create a new album on your phone and download 20 photos of cartoon characters, which use simple solid/flat colors, and are complete images/scenes (as opposed to just a character on a solid white background). Please select characters you are most familiar with. It is okay if a few different images are of the same character, but do try to sample from at least 5 different shows that you know of. Part three of this series will rely on the photos used for this training being as just described, so please stay within this framework.

Here is an example of a good image to be used with this exercise. Googling “{character_name} phone wallpaper” returns pretty good results usually.

Open the photo album and start with the first photo. Look, for a fraction of a second, at a specific sub-component of the character, for example their head. Glance away (eyes open) and retain seeing the sub-component. As you glance away, focus on retaining the image as brightly as you were just seeing it.

Now, the visual of the sub-component will begin to fade, as expected. When you look at an image, you are now able to form a prophantasic visual, but it only lasts a moment. To fix this, you must create a second prophantasic visual to replace the first, fading, one. The first prophantasic visual was created by using the original photo as a catalyst, the second prophantasic visual will be created by using the first, not-yet-faded, prophantasic visual as the catalyst. You can continue to “chain” these together as many times as you need to eventually cause your visual to be persisting.

It’s very important to focus intently on keeping the visuals as bright as they originally were, as you can only reference the previous visual as bright as it was.

Once this fades fully, go to the next sub-component within the image, for example the character's torso, and repeat the above exercise, then try with another sub-component, for example the character's legs. Each image you should aim to practice with 2-4 sub-components. After this, move on to the next image and do all of this again. Do this for all of the images in the album to complete one training session.

Once well developed, the effect will look something like this. Note how the retained visual seems to be phasing in and out with a frequency—this is a result of chaining together the prophantasic visuals, each referencing the previous. This “warping” effect does resolve with practice.

The more you work with this, the more you will notice that your tunnel-vision may start to expand, and, as you look at new sub-components, you may see previous sub-components reappearing in your prophantasic visuals. Give these reappearances your focus and joy (reward mechanism for the brain), so that your brain can learn to dedicate more bandwidth to expanding this field-of-view further.

Important: It is very easy to get stuck in the monotonous routine of this exercise and begin simply “going through the motions”—you must remind yourself, even each photo, if you have to, to seriously focus on getting as much brightness as you can out of each new prophantasic visual, and to focus on chaining together as many visuals in a row as you can. It will almost always be the case that you could have focused more, chained more, and persisted the image longer. Our brains naturally are averse to giving focus to visualization related tasks, so you must constantly remind yourself, every sub-component, to strive for more brightness and longer chains.

Additionally, tempting though it may be, don’t close your eyes for any part of this training, all of these exercises should be done with your eyes opened, each time.

Before beginning with part three, you should be at the point where you can look at any cartoon character from the previous exercise, look away, and retain it as well as the “developed case” example video from the previous video, which can be viewed here. If you can not consistently do this, please continue working with the second post.

When I use the phrase “project”, I am describing seeing a visual on one’s prophantasic screen, which interferes with one’s eye-sight. This is not as magical as it sounds, the visual is not “projected” into reality akin to “augmented-reality”, a better analogy would be this: When one is looking through a window, then notices something from inside the room in the reflection of the window—it’s more of a visual interference which one can shift their focus to, and as one does, the reflection becomes the dominant image and the imagery outside the window shifts away from their attention. In this analogy, the window is the eyes while the reflection is one’s visualizations.



Projecting from Short-Term Memory

At this point in the process, you are able to project a visual from your immediate memory. You are seeing what you just saw. You may have begun to notice some psychological effects occurring from the image chaining technique, for example the visual may slowly morph or change as you keep recalling it to the screen. This is similar to the childhood game “telephone” but with visual information begin mutated.

You are actually able to project from longer term memory than just what you were immediately looking at. To begin working with this, you should continue doing the exercise from the previous post, but with a variation. Now, instead of looking at multiple sub-components of the image, and looking away each time—instead just study the whole image, looking for 1-3 seconds at the various sub-components, then look away and retain the imagery you were just looking at (i.e. the last sub-component you studied). Now, as you retain seeing this, try to explore and look at some of the other sub-components, which you were just studying, in your prophantasic visual. At first you won’t succeed with this, but they will eventually emerge. When they do try to pull them into your image chaining, increasing the overall depth and brightness of the visual you are retaining. Always move on to the next image after just one attempt, or you may cause false after-images relating to cone/rod fatigue rather than true visualizations.

In the previous posts, I referred to this process of retaining imagery in your eye-sight as “accessing the screen”. The process (of shifting from seeing what your eyes see to what the prophantasic screen is holding) is one that can be tapped in to as a kind of “muscle memory” for the mind. To project from memory, you have to learn to “zone out” into this “screen” at-will. The more you work with shifting from seeing to retaining, the better you can get at learning what this “motion” of zoning out to prophantasia feels like.

Once the prophantasic visuals have faded away fully, take an additional second to relax and zone out and try to allow them to fade back in. This is where the aforementioned “muscle memory” comes into play. You must “zone out” back to the screen, on command. When the visuals do fade back in, it is INCREDIBLY subtle at first and demands acute attention, or it will be missed. At first, you will just barely have a hint of an understanding that some visual information is still there. Even though the visual is gone, you will have an understanding about properties of sub-components that seem to have remained. As you focus on them, they can start to re-emerge. Focus hard to find these residual hints of knowledge of visual imagery and pull them out anywhere you can detect them. This requires focus but you also must be relaxed at the same time, this is “zoning out”. Try this every time, after every image, even if you aren't succeeding.



Projecting from Long-Term Memory

Once you get to the point that you can consistently pull parts of visuals back up, after they have faded away, even if just barely, you are successfully projecting visual information from your short-term memory. You should then begin practicing projecting from long-term memory.

To do so, after each and every character in a training session, think for a moment about other characters from the show that this current cartoon character is from. You may think of other characters from your photo album or characters which aren’t part of our photo album at all, but that you know well. Zone out and use the mental “muscle memory” of relaxing your eyes and shifting into that prophantasic screen. Pay very close attention, again, to any visual disturbances that appear or any hints of silent visual understanding, emerging in the mind, regarding that character’s visual sensory properties. Eventually prophantasic visuals will form relating to the character you are thinking about.

From here, you can practice projecting visuals from long term memory. You simply think about a character, zone out to the screen, and start focusing on the visual information that emerges, in your memory, relating to that character. This will be significantly easier with flat/simple cartoon graphic characters. For a long time you will need to “warm up”, using the photo album, before you can directly project from memory—eventually you can project without using the album as a catalyst.

It may help you to zone out then inquire of your brain: "What would this zoning-out look like now, had I just been looking at an image of {character}? What colors and shapes would I be retaining and where in my field of view would they be projecting?". These inquiries should always be in the form of Sensory Thinking Patterns.

Once you are projecting a character from memory, to get more vividry out of the visual, you should explore thinking about any and all sub-components of the visual memory with Sensory Thinking Patterns. You have to do this every time or you will not progress in getting more vivid visuals. Please be aware to always ensure that your visual focus is in your prophantasic field of view. It can be easy at this stage to accidentally shift to thinking about memories using Traditional Phantasia, so always re-center yourself on trying to see a projection, not just see “in the back of your mind”.

Before beginning with part four, you should be at the point where you can consistently start to project a character from memory, no matter how vaguely. Here is an example of how a developed case should look, in this example video, the viewer is “dragging” (projecting) a cartoon character (Bender from Futurama) from their working memory, and then, using their long term memory, begins to ponder (with sensory thinking patterns) the visual information surrounding another cartoon character (Fry from Futurama) and visual interference begins to emerge which is definitely correlated to those thoughts of that character. Here is the example video.

It’s okay if you still have to do a warm up, with the cartoon exercise, to get to the state that you can project other characters from long-term memory—but you should be at the point where you can always get to that state any time you set out to try. If you can not consistently do this, please continue working with the third post.


Seeing Your Thoughts
To begin training seeing your thoughts, you need to get a list of 100 cartoon characters you know. Since I grew up in the 90s, I am familiar with the Pokemon characters (of which there are hundreds) so the list was easy for me to make, but if you need help, here is a list of the top 500 most famous cartoon characters for you to select from. Format this list so that each character is on its own line with lots of white-space (line breaks) in-between each character line.

Now, save photos, to a new album, of the first 50 cartoon characters on your list, do not look-up nor save photos of the last 50 characters.

To start the session, perform the exercise of looking at these first 50 characters and looking away while continuing to see them in your prophantasic field-of-view, one by one.

Next, go to the list and look at the first name. Zone out, relax your focus, move your gaze towards the white space surrounding the name. Switch to sensory thinking patterns and use the mental “muscle memory” of shifting focus to your prophantasic “screen”. You should be able to get some vague visual information to project, clearly relating to the character you just read. Once this happens, move to the next character and go through the whole list.

The first 50 will train projecting from short-term memory, the last 50 will train projecting from long-term memory. Don’t look up photos of the last 50 characters, your brain will eventually project them from your memory—the memory does exist, you do know what the character looks like, the information is in there.

This technique produces much more progress as you can increase your speed; so, aim to get to the point where you can almost immediately project visual information relating to a character, then move to the next one. The faster you can drill through the list, the more development you will begin to see.

As you work with this exercise, you will get to the point eventually where things you generally think about, outside of the exercise, may start projecting visual information into your prophantasic field-of-view (in my experience this generally only happens when you try to make it happen, but it seems it can become a ‘default’ state-of-mind, more and more over time, if you strive for it to be such). This is the beginning of seeing one's own thoughts with prophantasia.
