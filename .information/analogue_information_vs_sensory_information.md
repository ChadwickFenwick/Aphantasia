There are two main types of information used in the brain, analogue-information and sensory-information. Everyone stores and accesses this information subconsciously, but Aphants do not strongly access sensory-information consciously. Learning to recognize your sensory-information is crucial to strengthening your access to said information; as your accessibility strengthens, the sensory information can be re-simulated strongly in the brain, which causes you to re-experience senses in the brain. This can be a strong foundation to build the mind’s senses on, not just visual senses but all senses.


Analogue Information vs Sensory Information

Analogue information is simply analytical data about an experience. For example “The ball was red”, “The ball was round”, “The ball was 6 inches in diameter”.

Sensory information is a data representation of the experience through the senses. For example [an image of the ball], [the smell of the ball’s rubber], [the sound the ball makes when it hits the ground].

Sensory information can-not be accurately represented via analogue information. No matter how many “words” you use, you can-not accurately describe a scene you are looking at (A picture is worth [more than] a thousand words). This can only be represented with the entire data from the eyes themselves, not the lesser analyzed information that is derived from the scene later, after processing.


Sensory Information in the Aphantasic Brain

Aphants only think with analogue information, they have not learned to consciously access their sensory information reliably. The brain does, however, store sensory information, in fact your brain already works with this information subconsciously.

When you recognize something you’ve seen before, this is a result of your subconscious mind working with stored visual sensory information. If it were only using your analogue information to make comparisons, there would be obvious cognitive errors that arise, such as visual agnosia.

When I cured my aphantasia, I was AMAZED at how much visual sensory information existed in my brain, that I never had conscious access to before. The amount of things I knew (that I didn’t know I knew [because I couldn’t access the knowledge]) was pretty surprising. When I think back on events (even from a decade ago), I now know things like the clothes that people were wearing. Prior to curing my aphantasia, I couldn’t have told you what clothes you were wearing yesterday (unless it was noteworthy enough that my brain kept a second record of it as analogue information)—now that I can “see”, I can just think back on the event, re-see it, see what clothes you were wearing via my stored sensory-information (which I can now access) and then I can give you the answer, analogue.


Accessing Sensory Information

So, how can one access their sensory information consciously? You likely already do in very vague ways that are so subtle you would not notice. For example, prior to taking the first bite of a food item, when you expect a food item to taste one way; during this moment of anticipation, you are likely consciously accessing your stored sensory-information of the ‘flavor’ of the food item. If you then take a bite and it tastes off, you immediately know, that is accomplished through subconscious comparison to the sensory information. If you then consciously think, "well what's off about it? Ah, it should be more sweet", you consciously accessed your stored sensory-information to answer that question.

I will list a few examples, utilizing various senses, so that you can gauge your current access to sensory information. As an aphant, your default will likely be to just read and digest this text merely as information and march on to the next set of text, because that is what we are used to doing, please do actually try to think-about/simulate the theoretical sensory experience in your mind as you read each example:

• Think about how it would sound if you were to drop a pen on the floor right now? (Try, now, to access any generic memory of a pen falling [remember, not with analogue thinking]—you've surely heard a pen drop many times, recorded into many memories, somewhere, accessible to you, even now). You are likely vaguely remembering how it should sound when it hits via stored sensory-information. If you were only using analogue information, then you would only know how the sound should sound in ways that words can describe (e.g. “loud”, “crash”, “click”), but you likely know a little more than just analogue information. Compare the difference between how the pen would sound dropped on a glass surface vs a wood surface, you likely experienced having an understanding of the difference, even though you can’t accurately put it into words. This ‘understanding’ is you accessing your sensory-information; you do this very weakly, strongly phantasic people do this so strongly they actually can re-hear these events in their mind, you likely won't re-hear anything but will have a sense of understanding that goes beyond just descriptive word thoughts.

• Think about that time you tried orange juice after brushing your teeth. Is there any knowledge that surfaces in your mind, no matter how subtle, that is too complex to put into mere words (analogue information)? You may almost feel the strange sensation about to occur again on your tongue (of course, your access is so weak, you won’t actually feel it yet, but a strongly phantasic person would).

• Did you ever get an indian-sun-burn performed on your arm when you were a kid? Can you remember the sting which feels so good? If you have any knowledge in your memory beyond just the analogue descriptive information, you are tapping into sensory-information. Some of you may even be ever so slightly re-experiencing the feeling, incredibly subtly, for a moment; if so, you may have stronger access to your tactile-sensory-information than you realized.

• Think about how it would feel to strongly squeeze a handful of dice. Do you get any sense of knowledge/memory of the sensory properties associated with the feeling of the defined corners of the dice pressing harshly into your palm at different angles?

• Think about how it would feel to grind various textures across your teeth, like a paper-towel or sand.

• If you were to slide your tongue across a rough serrated edge, would you “know” what it would feel like with a knowledge that goes beyond just descriptively describing the event? Is there some deeper understanding occurring, in the back of your head, that has to be translated into words, because the native form of this information is not ‘words’?

• In your mind right now, do you understand the difference between the color blue and the color red? Is that difference even something that could even be represented via analogue thought? Try, and you may find that you can’t represent this understanding in analogue words.

• Do you know the scent of a rose? Can this knowledge you have possibly be accurately represented with mere analogue information?

• Can you, from memory alone, think of other aromas which relate to the smell of your favorite cologne/perfume? (assuming you haven't already made [analogue] note of that in the past).

• You've had chocolate milk and strawberry milk, you have an understanding of the difference in these flavors that goes beyond just analogue data—can you try to gain an understanding of how other flavored milks (that may not exist) would taste? (e.g Lime milk, Coconut milk, Orange milk, Banana milk). Did something happen, subtly, in your mind beyond just analogue thought?

• Garlic tastes nothing like orange or pear, but which of the two would subjectively be closer in terms of flavor profile? A question like this can't easily be answered from analogue information alone. If you are able to attempt to answer such a question, you are probably, even if weakly, accessing stored sensory information.

• Marge Simpson has yellow skin and blue hair, that is analogue information, but what are the exact shades of these colors? Can you try to gain an understanding for this answer even though words don't exist to communicate the answer once you do understand it? Likewise, her hair is tall and curly, analogue descriptions, but can you ponder about the specific shape of her hair style? Surely you could draw it even though no analogue information can exist for such a thing. Can you gain a sense for the visual shape of it without words? How strongly can you focus/explore into this 'sense'?

**If you did not experience any knowledge, beyond analogue knowledge, when thinking about these things—please make sure you have proper focus first. For a guide on how to properly focus when exploring sensory information, see here.

**If you still were unable to experience any sensory-thinking of any of the senses above, please refer to this post on how to activate sensory-thinking.


Re-experiencing Sensory Information

The more you access your mind’s sensory information, your neural paths will strengthen and you will be able to access more of this information, more effortlessly, and with more bandwidth. For some of you, you may find that you already have a stronger connection with some senses as opposed to others; you will all experience that you have virtually zero-access with visual sensory information, which is why you know you have aphantasia.

As your bandwidth to this information strengthens, you can eventually experience actually re-simulating the sense in your mind. I have been focused solely on improving my mind’s eye (visuals), but have also loosely been accessing other sensory information from time to time and already I am finding, after just a few weeks, that I can loosely re-experience certain sounds and smells in the back of my mind. At first, the effect develops so weakly that one would be hesitant to call it ‘smelling in your mind’ or ‘hearing in your mind’, but it truly does get stronger and stronger to the point where it’s unmistakable, you really are smelling actual smells in your mind, or hearing actual sounds in your mind, or seeing actual images in your mind.

So, remember as many things as you can, and try to tap into any sensory information you can. Do this over and over any time you have free time and it will slowly but surely develop. Try to use memories that involve all of the senses, for example a local restaurant you like, what are some of their food items, do you have a familiarity with how they should look on a plate, or what the plate looks like, how the plate feels if you were to press your finger against it, your knowledge of the food's smell or taste, which can't be accurately put into analogue words, how the seats feel, how it sounds when a glass loudly breaks in the back, where everything in the restaurant is, positionally speaking, in relation to everything else, etc. Your ability to tap into any of these sensory memories will be virtually non-existent at first, but it will get stronger over time and eventually you will even begin re-experiencing some of these senses in your mind as you think about them.

“If anyone imagines that he knows something, he does not yet know as he ought to know” - 1 Corinthians 8:2


Notes

If you have an inner-monologue, and are practicing tapping into audible sensory information (sound), be careful to not mistake your inner-monologue merely miming or doing an impression of the sound for a recollection of the sound itself. Your inner-monologue must be silent.

Accessing visual sensory information is likely going to be hardest for you compared to the other senses. When you try to recall how a scene looked you have to do it purely with sensory-information, you shouldn’t be using analogue information to list off information about the scene, if you have an inner-monologue, it should be silent. When accessing this visual sensory information, you won't see anything in your mind at first, because you're not developed enough; but, it will feel different than how you normally think about these things—this time, your mind is silent, there is no analytical lists or facts or data, you're just kind of getting a sense of knowing about the whole scene, all at once, even if you aren't seeing it.

Suppose you are trying to recall the visual appearance of a person… if you find yourself trying to list off various components like “Their hair is blonde”, and then you think about their eyes and say “their eyes are blue”, that's all analogue-information-based thought and won't develop phantasia. You, instead, need to just have a sense that you've tapped into the sensory information and nothing more. It should just feel like you've accessed the knowledge that you know what they look like; that familiar sense is all you're going for at first. In time, you can access it with more and more bandwidth and eventually you will start getting the faintest flashes in the back of your head, which you won’t think of as an ‘image’ in your head at first, but after a while you’ll realize there really is no other way to describe what’s happening in your mind except ‘image’. This is the very beginning of phantasia.

Suppose you gaze across a landscape, or you go to a museum and look at a painting, you don't need to sit there and look at each component of the scene and one by one take note of all the analytical details in order, analogue. You just “take in” the whole scene at once, and the analogue part of your brain is silent. Think about this feeling of “taking it all in” at once, you aren't exploring the image and describing it, you just know the whole thing all at once, and that feels a little different than how you normally “know” things. If you can recognize that feeling; that same mechanism is how people access visual sensory information in their mind. When you think about something you know well, try to grasp the entire scene at once, don't try to analytically go through the scene’s analogue description, you should just get a feel that you're “taking in” the whole visual memory at once.

When working with visual sensory information, be careful to not focus too much on spatial-awareness, this is an important part of visualization, but it’s actually a separate process in the brain from imagery, so make sure to keep a balance between recalling spatial properties of a scene vs visual properties of a scene.

When learning to visualize, you must learn to shift your thinking-pattern to one that is more sensory in nature. The only thinking-pattern you’ve ever used, as an aphant, is analogue in nature. This post builds on top of the existing Analogue Information vs Sensory Information post, please read that first if you haven’t already.

Obligatory status disclosure (rule 3) — I had total Aphantasia for 27 years, I can now visualize and have been training for about 6 months. I am able to visualize anything I have seen before, though it is not always vivid. I can visualize both with traditional phantasia and prophantasia. I can also think/recall multi-sensory with all 5 senses now. I would estimate my visual abilities are around 3.5/10, and they improve every week.



Types of Thinking Patterns
We have already differentiated the two types of information in the brain, analogue vs sensory. This trait applies to not just information but also thoughts themselves, and more specifically thinking styles or thinking-patterns.

Simplified, a thinking-pattern is simply a way in which you think about things. When it comes to thinking patterns, aphants have, for the most part, only ever used analogue thinking patterns, whereas visualizers use a mix.

So, if you saw a cow and wanted to think about how it looked, and inquired of your brain “How many legs did that cow have”, this is likely the start of an analogue thinking pattern, because the information your brain returns to your inquiry, will be analogue in nature (i.e. “four”).

For a native visualizer, this thinking-pattern may be analogue or sensory, because the information their brain returns may be analogue in nature (i.e. “four”) or it may be sensory in nature (i.e. the visual image of the cow having four legs, which the visualizer then consciously translates into an answer with no additional memory based inquiries). For a native visualizer, they may use either thinking pattern, but for an aphant, only analogue thinking patterns will be used.

• Analogue Thinking Patterns are ones in which analogue information is retrieved from memory.

• Sensory Thinking Patterns are ones in which sensory information is retrieved from memory.

• Ambiguous Thinking Patterns are ones in which either analogue or sensory information are used. (E.g. the cow legs’ cardinality example above).

• Symbiotic Thinking Patterns are ones in which both analogue and sensory information are used.

When working with visual information in your brain (which is sensory in nature), if you are using Ambiguous Thinking Patterns, you, as an aphant, will default to using analogue information in these thoughts. This thinking pattern should, therefore, be avoided when training.



Forcing Sensory Thinking Patterns
To change your thinking patterns to be visual, you must adopt a thinking style, when exploring memories that are visual in nature, which is only answerable with sensory information. In doing so, you will silence your inner monologue (if you have one) and will not be able to continue thinking analogue about such thoughts. To do this you must ask your own mind questions which can’t be answered analogue.

For example, if you were thinking about a cartoon character you know well, or even had just seen, if you asked a question to your mind, like, “What color was their shirt?”—this is an Ambiguous Thinking Pattern, because it can be answered analogue or sensory (and for you this will be analogue). If you instead inquired “What was the exact shade of the color of their shirt?”, this forces the inquiry to be in the sensory realm, because you can’t possibly answer such a question analogue, as words don’t truly exist for exact shades of colors. A native visualizer, as they access the sensory information, would simply “see” the exact shade. As an aphant, you won’t yet “see” the answer, but you can still access the sensory information, and you will gain some sort of understanding or knowledge relating to the question, that can’t be put into words.

Another example would be thinking about the form of an object. If you inquired your brain what the shape of Stewie Griffin’s (from Family guy) head is, you may answer analogue “football shaped”, but if you can adjust your thinking pattern to be concerned with the specifics of the shape, there is no possible way for your brain to answer analogue. Words don’t exist for specific exotic shapes. To begin to answer such an inquiry, your brain must work with sensory information, and in doing so you get a “feel” for the form of the object (and eventually, later on in your training, spontaneous internal imagery of the object).

You can access this information already. If you were to sit down and attempt to draw an outline of this form, you would succeed (more or less) and would succeed by referencing your sensory information. Thus, try to “air draw” with your finger right now, the shape or form of some cartoon characters you know well. As you work with this, you are using sensory thinking patterns, and accessing sensory information. You may also inquire about specific shades of color for various "sub-components" of these characters as you explore their forms, and you may gain understanding of those properties as well. Exploring the "sub-components" of an image is helpful for gaining more detail and vividry in the overall visual. For example, "What is the exact shape of her head, and shade of her hair -> what is the exact form of her smile and color of her lips -> what is the shape of her eyes and what specific shades of blue are they -> etc".

Force sensory thinking by formatting your mental inquiries in a way that can only be answered with sensory answers. For visual sensory thinking, this means inquiring to gain an understanding of specific/exact shades of colors and/or specific shapes of forms. Sensory thinking extends to all senses, not just the visual sense. You can adjust the way you think about inquiries to be more specific, in any of the sensory domains, to force the thinking pattern to become sensory. The goal is to only inquire your mind in ways where the answers must be sensory information. Then, over time, this new thinking-pattern, can become a ‘default’ style of thinking, as you work with visualization training (or any sensory phantasia training).

The more strongly you increase your access to sensory information, the more likely visuals are to start forming in the back of your mind as you think about these things. If you have an inner-monologue, you may notice it begin to silence as you force Sensory-only Thinking Patterns, over time, as you develop your access, you can pivot to Symbiotic Thinking Patterns, which will use your inner monologue and both analogue and sensory information.



Image Streaming
If you’ve tried image streaming, to no avail, you may now be realizing why that famous exercise’s success is so variable. It aims to increase one’s bandwidth to sensory information by stimulating sensory thought, but it relies on either Ambiguous or Symbiotic Thinking Patterns to accomplish this. If someone is already a native visualizer, this is great, as they can work sensory with such thinking patterns. If someone is a hypophant, it’s a toss-up, depending on how their brain may or may not already work. If someone is an aphant, it doesn’t seem to help at all (in my experience).
