This is a guide on how to develop traditional phantasia using sensory thinking.

Obligatory status disclosure (rule 3) — I had total Aphantasia for 27 years, I can now visualize and have been training for about 5 months. I am able to visualize anything I have seen before, though it is not always vivid. I can also now loosely visually imagine things I have not seen before. I can visualize both with traditional phantasia and prophantasia. I can also visualize and imagine multi-sensory with all 5 senses now. I would estimate my visual abilities are around 3/10, and they improve every week.


Prerequisites
Before you can begin, you need to have already successfully tapped into your mind’s stored sensory information. You need to know what sensory thinking is like, and how it differs from analogue thinking. Processing sensory information is a new style of thinking, that you are not used to, and is incompatible with your normal way of thinking. You have to understand how to think sensory (with ANY of the mind’s senses) before you can attempt thinking visual-sensory. If you have not succeeded in working with your mind’s sensory information, please read and reflect on the sensory information post until you have succeeded. You will not be able to proceed with the things discussed in this post until you have succeeded in sensory thinking.

Additionally, you’ll need re-learn what it means to visualize, if you have an incorrect understanding of what visualization is. Visualizing, in its fundamental form, does not involve conjuring or creating imagery in your head. You don’t create anything, you are just re-experiencing visual sensory information, and this causes your brain to [eventually] process this information the only way it can truly be processed—visually. This is automatic, it’s not you striving to conjure an image. If you are trying to create or force images in your head, your efforts are improperly focused; your brain will [eventually] create the imagery for you, your job is not to create images in your mind, it is just to focus on strongly accessing the sensory information. To do this, you must maintain proper focus.

(Addendum: visualization does advance to the point where you eventually are able to truly conjure up imagery in your mind [i.e. imagination], for the fundamental form of visualization though, which you must master first, this is not the case, and expecting visualization to be that way, at this stage, will misdirect you).

This is a tutorial for developing traditional phantasia, not prophantasia. If you don't fully comprehend the difference between these two, please read about that here, first.


Exercise
To start, shift your focus to be fully on your thoughts, you shouldn’t be striving to see anything, you need to zone-out into the place where your thoughts are and focus fully on your thoughts, not on attempting to see visuals.

With focus there, pick random things to explore, of which your brain already has visual information.

For example, you may think, “What does a dog look like?”.

Don’t answer the question with mere analogue facts like “furry, soft, four legs, etc”. Instead, you have to just try to recall a dog you’ve seen before, and have an understanding of his image.

You know all of the sensory things regarding this imagery in your memory—you have a sense for what the shape of the dog you’re thinking about is, what the blends of shades of colors of the fur should be like relative to each other, what the eyes and paws are like up-close, etc.

This sensory information already exists in your brain, you now have to get a sense for it without thinking about it, analogue. (Your inner monologue should be silent). You must think about these things with sensory-thinking, not analogue-thinking.

Edit: What I mean is, there are certain things you know about the object, analogue; and there are certain things you can only know about the object, sensory. For example if you inquire your brain "what color is the dog" you can answer analogue "dark brown", but if you instead inquired "what is the exact shade(s) of color of the dog" this can't be accurately answered analogue, there isn't a word for the exact shade(s), your brain has no choice but to use sensory thinking to accurately answer itself. The same applies to, for example, the shape of the dog. You can't accurately describe the shape of a dog with analogue words, but you do know the shape of the dog because you'd be able to draw such a shape on paper (assuming you have good drawing skills), so your brain has this sensory information and you can even tap into it, you just have to think about these things the right way, not the analogue thinking patterns you are used to, then you can teach your brain to more and more tap into sensory knowledge not analogue knowledge, as you ponder imagery. Also, "dog" may be a bad example for you if you don't have a dog you are recently and well familiar with, if so, perhaps substitute for a cartoon character you know well.

Now, tap into this “knowing”. You should have a ‘sense’ for how the dog looks, even though you aren’t “seeing” anything in your mind yet. Just try to get a deeper and stronger ‘sense’ of the visual information regarding the imagery you are recalling. Explore this non-analogue data and keep your focus inside your headspace. As this access and focus strengthens, you will eventually begin slowly getting very fleeting hints of imagery with/in your memory.

Keep repeating this with many various things you are visually-familiar with, for example, a food you eat often, a room you are frequently in (or the things inside that room), a cartoon character you have viewed often, etc.


Notes
You likely already have much more than you realize. For example, if you think about a couch you sit on often—

You have a feel for the shapes and curves of the couch, an understanding that exists to a detail that couldn’t be described accurately with just analogue words.

You know the specific shades of color of the couch (with accuracy that exceeds what would be possible with just analogue categorization [e.g. just “dark green”]).

You know the texture of the cushions, you know what it feels like when you slide your fingers across the fabric (in-fact, you’d likely be able to identify this texture if you were blind folded and sampled various textures, from memory alone).

You know the visual shapes/patterns of the fabric’s weave, which escapes the capacity of accurate representation through mere analogue description alone.

Try to recall all of these things without using analogue thought, you are simply trying to recollect on what it is like to ‘sense’ these sensory things, you should feel you are getting a ‘sense’ for what these visual properties are like.

In my experience, tangible imagery (e.g. a lake you’ve personally visited) works better than digital imagery (e.g. a lake from google images).

Please remember, you are NOT trying to use effort to willingly conjure images, this is not how visualization works at this stage, and will prevent you from progressing. If this is the approach you have been taking, you must re-define, in your mind, what it means to visualize. Visualizing does not come from brute-force effort, it’s not something you make happen, you are simply processing sensory data, which your brain will instinctively learn more and more to delegate to your visual cortex. This foundational style of visualizing is natural and effortless. You should not be trying to see images, you should just be trying to access your memories’ sensory information, and the visuals will eventually start to emerge on their own, naturally. A more intuitive term for visualizing (at the beginner level) is “re-seeing”.

With that in mind, STAY IN YOUR MEMORIES, you will have 10x more success trying to simply think (visually) about a place you were at last week, than, say, some arbitrary concept you don’t have a real memory of, like your dog in a red hat.


Development
As you practice this, you will become more aware that the way you are thinking about these things is different than how you normally think. This is thinking with sensory information, and is much more understanding and ‘sensing’ based than the kind of thought you normally use, which is purely analytical in nature.

Thinking with visual sensory information IS visualizing. When it is undeveloped, you don’t actually see anything—but, you do eventually being to see, as it develops. When you do finally begin to see, at first, it will be so weak and foreign and not what you expected/imagined visualizing was like, that you won’t even think of what is happening as ‘seeing’ in your mind… but eventually, as it develops, you’ll conclude more and more that there is simply no other way to describe this new thing happening in your brain, except “image”. From there, this faint fleeting sense of imagery in the back of your head can slowly progress into full, persisting, imagery, in the forefront of your focus.
