## The Concept

Image Streaming works by overloading the analytic mind and forcing the brain to interpret random neural noise as visual data.

## The Setup (Ganzfeld)

1.  **Darkness**: Close your eyes or stare into a uniform field (e.g., a red screen or a white wall).
2.  **Relax**: Deep relaxation is crucial.
3.  **The Screen**: Look past your eyelids into the "Eigengrau" (the dark gray noise). This is your "Autogogic Screen".

## The Process

1.  **Detect**: Look for any variation in the noise. A lighter patch? A blob? A fleck of color?
2.  **Describe**: Describe aloud what you see. "I see a faint grey blob moving to the left."
3.  **Interpret**: Assign meaning to the noise. "It looks like a cloud... or maybe a face."
4.  **Expect**: Once you tentatively identify a shape, *expect* to see the rest of it. "If that is a face, I should see a nose here."
5.  **Stream**: Keep the description flowing. Do not stop to think. If you see nothing, describe the darkness ("It is a deep, textured black...").

## Gradual Divided Focus

- **Look** into the screen (Physical/Autogogic).
- **Think** about the visuals (Mental/Sensory).
- Balance these two. As mental focus increases, the physical screen will begin to populate with hallucinations derived from your thoughts.

## Pitfalls

- **Forcing It**: Do not strain to see.
- **Analogue Drift**: Do not start listing facts. Keep descriptions purely visual (Color, Shape, Motion).
- **Stopping**: Do not stop describing. The continuous flow allows the visual cortex to bypass the censor.
