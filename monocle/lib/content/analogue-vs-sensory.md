## The Two Types of Information

There are two main types of information used in the brain: **Analogue** and **Sensory**. Everyone stores and accesses this information subconsciously, but Aphants do not strongly access sensory-information consciously.

### Analogue Information
Analogue information is simply analytical data about an experience.
- "The ball was red"
- "The ball was round"
- "The ball was 6 inches in diameter"

### Sensory Information
Sensory information is a data representation of the experience through the senses.
- [An image of the ball]
- [The smell of the ball’s rubber]
- [The sound the ball makes when it hits the ground]

Sensory information cannot be accurately represented via analogue information. No matter how many words you use, you cannot accurately describe a scene you are looking at. "A picture is worth a thousand words" because it contains raw data that words cannot capture.

## Sensory Information in the Aphantasic Brain

Aphants only think with analogue information; they have not learned to consciously access their sensory information reliably. **The brain does, however, store sensory information.**

When you recognize something you’ve seen before, this is a result of your subconscious mind working with stored visual sensory information. If it were only using your analogue information to make comparisons, there would be obvious cognitive errors (like visual agnosia).

## Accessing Sensory Information

You likely already access sensory information in vague ways:
- **Anticipation**: Before taking a bite of food, you expect a flavor. If it tastes "off," you know immediately because you compared it to a stored sensory memory.
- **Sound**: Think about dropping a pen. You vaguely know what it sounds like. You know how it differs from a pen dropping on carpet vs. wood. That understanding is sensory.
- **Touch**: Think about an "Indian Sunburn". You may remember the stinging sensation beyond just the word "sting".
- **Smell**: Can you vividly recall the scent of a rose? Or the difference between chocolate and strawberry milk?

## Thinking Patterns

To cure Aphantasia, you must shift your thinking patterns.

1.  **Analogue Thinking**: Retrieving facts/words. ("The shirt was blue")
2.  **Sensory Thinking**: Retrieving raw data. ("The exact shade of blue")
3.  **Ambiguous Thinking**: Questions that can be answered both ways. ("How many legs does a cow have?" -> "Four" [Analogue] vs Seeing the legs [Sensory]).

**Goal**: Force **Sensory Thinking Patterns**.
Ask questions that CANNOT be answered with words.
- "What is the *exact* curve of that line?"
- "What is the *specific* shade of color?"
- "What is the *texture* of that surface?"

By forcing your brain to answer these questions, it must recruit sensory hardware, slowly strengthening the neural pathways required for visualization.
