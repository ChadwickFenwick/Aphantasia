## What is Prophantasia?

**Traditional Phantasia**: Seeing images "in the mind's eye" (separate from physical vision).
**Prophantasia**: Projected visualization. Seeing images overlaying physical reality (hallucination-like).

Prophantasia occurs when visual signals originate from the mind but override the signals from the optic nerve before they are processed by the visual cortex.

## Technique 1: Accessing the Screen (The Glimpse)

1.  **The Target**: Find a high-contrast, simple image (e.g., a colored shape or cartoon character).
2.  **The Glimpse**: Look at it for less than **0.25 seconds**.
3.  **The Drag**: Sharply look away at a blank wall.
4.  **The Hold**: Try to "drag" the image with your eyes. Do not let your eyes adjust to the wall. Keep the "shape" of your focus locked on the image you just saw.

If successful, you will see a faint, positive afterimage (true colors, not inverted). This is your brain projecting from short-term memory.

## Technique 2: Visual Chaining

Once you can hold a glimpse:
1.  Look at one part of a complex image (e.g., a character's head).
2.  Look away and hold it.
3.  As it fades, look at the next part (e.g., the torso).
4.  Look away and try to attach it to the fading head.
5.  **Chain** these positive afterimages together to build a complete, persisting image.

## Technique 3: Projection from Memory

1.  Think of a character you know well.
2.  "Zone out" your eyes (relax focus, look 'through' the wall).
3.  Ask specific **Sensory Questions**: "What is the exact curve of their nose?", "What precise color is their hat?"
4.  As you answer these questions without words, visual interference will begin to appear in your field of view.
5.  Latch onto this interference and refine it.
