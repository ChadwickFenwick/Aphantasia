## Prerequisites

Before visualizing, you must understand **Sensory Thinking**. visual thoughts are not "made" or "conjured"; they are *re-experienced*.

## The Core Exercise

1.  **Zone Out**: Shift focus to your thoughts, not your eyes.
2.  **Pick a Topic**: Choose something familiar (e.g., your dog, a favorite room, a specific fruit).
3.  **Inquire**: Ask questions that require sensory answers.
    - *Incorrect*: "The dog is brown." (Analogue)
    - *Correct*: "What is the specific blend of colors on his ear?" (Sensory)
4.  **Sense**: You will not "see" immediately. You will get a "knowing" or a "sense" of the visual qualities.
    - You know the shape of the couch cushion.
    - You know the texture of the fabric.
    - You know the pattern of the weave.
5.  **Persist**: Keep exploring these sensory details. Eventually, this "knowing" becomes stronger and begins to manifest as fleeting visual impressions.

## Notes

- **Effortless**: Do not strain. Visualization is a passive process of processing information.
- **Relive**: It is easier to "re-see" a memory (a place you visited yesterday) than to "imagine" a fantasy (a dragon). Start with memories.
- **Spatial**: Be careful not to rely solely on spatial awareness (where things are). Focus on visual properties (color, light, texture).
